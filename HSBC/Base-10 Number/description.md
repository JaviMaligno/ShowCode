# Description

Given a number in base-10 format as an integer, convert the number to a different base.

The input number and the target base will be supplied and you should output the new number as a string.

Letters should be returned as capitals and any leading zeroes, which do not represent the value of the output, should not be included in the output string.

Your solution should handle negative inputs and return `"INDETERMINATE"` for invalid inputs/bases.
