# Challenge description


ROT-13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a very basic Caesar cipher where each letter is substituted with the letter 13 places after it in the basic Latin alphabet.

For example:

The cow jumped over the moon

Would becomeâ€¦

Gur pbj whzcrq bire gur zbba

* Numbers and punctuation should be unaffected by the cipher
* Case should be maintained
* Special characters (such as accented letters) should be unaffected by the cipher
* Null input should return an empty string

Create a ROT-13 cipher.
